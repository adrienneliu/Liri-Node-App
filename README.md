## About 
LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. It takes in 4 commands: concert-this, spotify-this-song, movie-this, and do-what-it-says.
After the user selects a command (i.e, movie-this) and passes information (Harry Potter), Liri will return some more details about a Harry Potter movie, such as the ratings, plot summary, actors, and year released.
